# Marvel-Quiz

Marvel-Quiz is a small React JS Web App using advanced skills like Hooks, React-Router and API. This app is builded with Firebase and uses Firestore cloud functions !

## Description

After learning HTML/CSS and Javascript (ES6), 
my objective was to learn ReactJs coding a simple but complete webApp from scratch.
I choose this theme because I love Marvel universe and it looks cool!

To do it, I had to learn React basics
* Components concept
* how to initialize an app
* what are props and states
* Class and functions
* Destructuring
* Component's lifecycles
* PureComponent
* High Order component
* And a lot of other concepts ...

Then I learned new concepts in react V17 with Hooks !!!

After this, let's get coding.
